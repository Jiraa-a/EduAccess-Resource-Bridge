# EduAccess-Resource-Bridge
EduAccess Resource Bridge is a peer-to-peer marketplace and donation platform designed to connect individuals who have surplus educational resources with students who lack access to them.
The platform aims to reduce educational inequality by enabling the redistribution of textbooks, study materials, devices (such as laptops and calculators), and other academic essentials.

### Problem Statement
High-quality educational materials and physical resources such as textbooks, reference guides, and laptops are often discarded or left unused by graduates.
At the same time, many underprivileged students struggle to access these resources due to financial limitations. This imbalance leads to unnecessary waste on one side and lack of opportunity on the other.

### Proposed Solution
EduAccess Resource Bridge provides a structured and accessible digital platform where users can:

📚 Donate unused educational materials
💰 Sell or exchange academic resources at affordable prices
🔍 Request specific learning materials
🤝 Connect directly with peers in a secure environment

By facilitating direct peer-to-peer interaction, the platform ensures transparency, accessibility, and efficient resource redistribution.
